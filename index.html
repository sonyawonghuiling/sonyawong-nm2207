        <p>Hi there! SPACE is a data story on a social issue that I resonate with deeply. This is a final project submission as part of a module in the NUS CNM department.</p>
        <p>I'm Sonya, the creator of this site, and I'm a Year 2 NUS Undergraduate majoring in Political Science.</p> 
        <a style="color:black; text-decoration: underline" href="https://nm2207.org/2223S2/e0774698/web/">Feel free to explore my other works done for this module here.</a> <br>

        <i style="color: navy">Oh! And, look out for tips along the way to better guide you along the data story! (They'll be blue and italicised, just like this.)</i> <br>
        
        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>SPACE, like its namesake, is a data story on the spatial availability in Singapore. I was inspired by my own worries about finding stability and security in Singapore after I graduate from university. As a young 
            undergraduate concerned about my place in Singapore in the future, I believe that many of my peers carry the same concerns as I do. This led me to think about the scarcity in Singapore â€“ how we have little land 
            and resources, yet our population growth is unprecendented, bordering on a problem of overcrowding. Therefore, I hope that this data story will be able to give a more in-depth glimpse into an illustration of 
            current population statistics and make logical predictions about what may come in the near future.  I seek to answer the big question, "How much space is there left in Singapore?" through looking at population indicators.
